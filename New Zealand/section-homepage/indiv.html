                <div class="content">
					<p>Hi, my name is Ryan Dempster and I was born on the 5th of December  2002. <img src="images/about-me.jpg" alt="picture of me" id ="me">
					<br>
					<br>
I have are four people in my family (five if you count our dog - Cooper), my mam, my dad and my younger sister.
<br> 
I am  half Irish and half Kiwi/New Zealander, but I was born and raised in Ireland.
<br>
<br>
I am doing ‘Enterprise Computing’ at DCU. 
<br>
I have a passion for anything involving computers and have a basic understanding of <code>Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</code> 
<br>
<br>
In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies and tv series. My favourite movie is ‘Parasite’ and my favourite tv series is ‘Attack on Titan’. 
<br>
When I’m not watching tv and movies I have a few hobbies that I enjoy:
					<ul>
						<li>Football
						<li>Basketball
						<li>Tennis
						<li>Chess
						<li>Video games
					    <li>Krav maga

					</ul>

                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <div class="content">
				<p>
					I did work experience in <a href= https://grantthornton.ie/ target="_blank">Grant Thornton</a> who are an accounting and consulting firm. 
					<br>
					<br>
					I was in the business risk and analysis department as an intern of sorts. While there I became much more proficient in PowerPoint and Microsoft Excel. 
					<br>
					<br>
					They had me perform many different tasks and I experienced many different things throughout my work experience:
				<ul>
					<li>Creating a PowerPoint for a new piece of business risk analysis software they were going to release
					<li>Compiling a list of the top thirty building/engineering companies in Ireland.
					<li>Organising documents by assigning them to the directory of the company they belong to.
					<li>A course on effective communication, which improved my skills in public speaking and building rapport with others and customers.
				</ul>
					I have also been working at <a href= https://crokepark.ie/stadium target="_blank">Croke Park</a>, handing out match-day programmes and working the stiles. These duties let me put the skills I learned in the effective communication course to use and helped me further improve upon them.

					<figcaption> My Grandad taught me how to play chess and it has been something that I really enjoyed playing with him since I was about 10. .I am not particularly good but I enjoy playing it. I recently watched 'The Queen's Gambit' on Netflix and it has made me play chess a lot more. It's really developed my problem solving abilities, and led to my interest in Computer Science.</figcaption>

					<figcaption> Attack on Titan is a show I found on Netflix and it was incredibly well written, intense and the voice acting was decent. I didn't realize until I went looking for a season 2 of the show that it was originally in Japanese. Despite that, I really enjoy the series and I am really looking forward to the final season.</figcaption>
